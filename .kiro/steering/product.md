- See payment summary with net amount calculation
- Edit pending reimbursements
- Delete pending reimbursements

### Payment Transfers (העברות)

A new payment execution system that groups approved reimbursements by recipient and budget type, allowing treasurers to efficiently execute payments in batches.

#### Key Concepts

**Payment Transfer**: A collection of approved reimbursements and charges for a specific recipient from a specific budget type (circle or group). When a reimbursement or charge is approved, it automatically joins an open payment transfer for that recipient and budget type.

**Automatic Grouping**: The system automatically creates and manages payment transfers. When a treasurer approves a reimbursement or charge, it's associated with an open transfer for the recipient/charged user. If no open transfer exists, one is created automatically.

**Net Amount Calculation**: Payment transfers calculate the net amount by summing reimbursements (positive) and subtracting charges (negative). This ensures users receive the correct net payment after debts are deducted.

**Budget Type Separation**: Circle budget reimbursements/charges and group budget reimbursements/charges are kept in separate transfers even for the same user, ensuring proper budget tracking and access control.

#### Payment Transfer Workflow

1. **Approval**: When a reimbursement or charge is approved in the "אישור החזרים" (Reimbursement Approval) page, it automatically joins an open payment transfer for the user and budget type
2. **Grouping**: All approved reimbursements and charges for the same user and budget type are grouped into a single pending transfer
3. **Net Calculation**: Transfer total = sum of reimbursements - sum of charges
4. **Execution**: Treasurer navigates to "העברות" (Transfers) page and executes the transfer
5. **Completion**: All reimbursements and charges in the transfer are automatically marked as "paid" with execution timestamp and executor recorded

#### Key Features

**Automatic Transfer Management**
- Transfers created automatically when reimbursements or charges are approved
- No manual transfer creation required
- Automatic calculation of net amount (reimbursements - charges) and item count
- Real-time updates as reimbursements and charges are approved

**Transfer Listing and Filtering**

**Access Control**

- Group treasurers: See only transfers for their group budget reimbursements
- Budget type filtering applied automatically based on treasurer role
- Execution permission verified before allowing transfer execution

**Audit Trail**

### Monthly Fund Allocation and Tracking

A comprehensive system for managing and tracking fund allocations on a monthly basis, providing granular financial planning and monitoring capabilities.

#### Key Concepts

**Monthly Allocation**: The amount of money allocated to a fund for a specific month. Treasurers can set allocations using either fixed (same amount every month) or variable (different amounts per month) strategies.

**Allocation Types**:
- **Fixed Allocation**: Set a single amount that applies to all months starting from the current month
- **Variable Allocation**: Set different amounts for each month of the year individually

**Planning vs Execution Separation**: The system maintains a clear separation between planning and actual execution:
- **Planning Track**: Shows what was planned (planned expenses) vs what wasn't planned (buffer)
- **Execution Track**: Shows what actually happened (spent) vs what remains available
- **Variance Analysis**: Compares planning to execution to identify deviations

This separation allows for:
- Better budget analysis and forecasting
- Understanding planning accuracy
- Identifying systematic over/under-spending patterns
- Maintaining realistic available budgets (not reduced by plans that may not materialize)

**Monthly Tracking**: Track actual spending, planned expenses, and remaining budget for each fund on a monthly basis with three parallel views:
1. **Actual Execution**: Allocated → Spent → Remaining
2. **Planning**: Allocated → Planned → Unplanned
3. **Variance**: Planned vs Actual with deviation percentage

#### Monthly Allocation Management

**Allocation Manager Modal** (ניהול הקצאות חודשיות):
- Accessible from fund detail pages (treasurer only)
- Toggle between fixed and variable allocation modes
- Real-time validation against total fund budget
- Visual summary showing total allocated, remaining unallocated

- Simple and quick for consistent monthly budgets

**Variable Allocation Mode**:
- Grid of 12 month inputs (Hebrew month names)
- Set different amounts for each month
- Flexible for seasonal or varying budgets

  3. **Variance Table**: Planned vs Actual with deviation indicators
- Monthly expenses table with all reimbursements for the month
- Monthly planned expenses table
