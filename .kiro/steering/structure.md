- **Build**: Vite config in `frontend/vite.config.ts`

## Development Workflow

1. **Setup**: Use Docker Compose or manual Node.js setup
2. **Database**: Run migrations and seeds for initial data
3. **Development**: Backend on :4567, Frontend on :3456
4. **API**: RESTful endpoints under `/api/` prefix
